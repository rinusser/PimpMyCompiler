# Synopsis

A proof of concept of an LLVM-based compiler capable of producing LLVM-based compilers.


# General

A rationale will be added later (#2).

Short version: I'm trying to figure out a multistage bootstrap process for a (mostly) self-compiling compiler. This project will help me figure out the critical stages.


# Requirements

* LLVM (tested with 4.0)
* gcc (tested with 6.3.0)
* GNU Make
